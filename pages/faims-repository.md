The FAIMS repository is a digital repository for storing documents, datasets, images and sensory data produced by archaeological research in Australia or collected by Australian archaeologists working abroad.

Powered by the [tDAR platform](http://www.tdar.org/), FAIMS Repository provides a place for data collected in the field to be archived, protected and optionally shared with other researchers.

Using the FAIMS Repository, researchers can archive their data and maintain confidentiality and privacy of datasets while research is still being carried out with the data. Data can be made public to open it up for access by other researchers.
