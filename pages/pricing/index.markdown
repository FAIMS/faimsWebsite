The FAIMS repository will be free to search, discover and download resources.

While we are still in development, there will be no cost to the upload of datasets. Please contact repository@fedarch.org if you wish to contribute.

From 2015, there will be charges for depositing data to cover the ongoing costs of the repository.

A schedule of fees will be prepared in 2014.
