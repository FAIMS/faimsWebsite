## Mobile digital applications used by archaeologists and other researchers during field data collection

* [**Cybertracker**](http://cybertracker.org/) - Mobile tool for georeferenced field data collection used by archaeologists, ethnographers environmental scientists all around the world.
* IADB, **the [Integrated Archaeological Database](http://www.iadb.org.uk/)** is not only a server based database used by a number of projects in the UK, but it has also a mobile component that runs on iOS, Kindle touch and Android. You need to contact Michael Rains to get your hands on the prototypes of those.
* **Open Data Kit**[http://opendatakit.org/](http://opendatakit.org/about/) - ODK is an open-source suite of tools for mobile data collection, whose development was spearheaded by Google.com and the University of Washington, Seattle. Excellent especially in connection with Open Layers and internet connection.
* **[Open Layers](http://openlayers.org/)**, is a open source map rendering app.
* [**Mobile Data Studio**](http://www.creativitycorp.com/mds/) is another application commonly used by archaeologists to create electronic forms and mobile device applications they need.
* [**TapForms**](http://www.tapforms.com/) is a SQLite based mobile information manager tool for iPhone and iOS systems.
* [**eForms**](http://wiki.modxcms.com/index.php/EForm) - E-Form is an electronic version of a paper form, which can be distributed online and has a programming layer and can validate and automate data input. eForms are used by universities for administrative purposes (data collection, reporting), but also by archaeological projects for field data collection. Download  the 1.4.3 release [here](http://modx.com/extras/package/eform). If you don't want to do your own, there are business solutions to mobile data capture from firms such as [Mi-Co](http://www.mi-corporation.com/mobile-data-capture/), who offer offline capable mobile solutions for iOs, Windows or Android.
