# About FAIMS

The Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project (FAIMS project) is an eResearch initiative developed at UNSW, Australia and currently housed at the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University. Led by two archaeologists, a historian and a digital humanist and aided by casual programming staff, the FAIMS team has delivered 25 field recording systems over its lifetime (2012-present) to various field disciplines from archaeology, ecology, to geochemistry. We have a history of excellence in requirements elicitation, testing, delivering, and maintaining research-capable digital recording modules.

# Make your fieldwork digital

*The FAIMS Mobile Platform helps you spend less time digitising and more time learning from your data.*

Data is automatically synced and backed up, offline and on-site. If you have an Internet connection, you can also sync to the cloud. The FAIMS Mobile Platform records a full history of all data collected and any changes made. It can be tailored to work with any workflow, ontology or standard. Contact us for a demonstration and for more information about how the FAIMS Mobile Platform can make your fieldwork easier.

# Archive, protect and share your data with ease

*The FAIMS Repository helps you store and archive your data.*

Based on tDAR, the FAIMS Repository provides a place for researchers to archive their data and maintain confidentiality and privacy of datasets while research is still being carried out with the data. Data can be made public to open it up for access by other researchers.

# What our users say:

> ... the tablet app worked very well in the field and I would be keen to continue using it for subsequent sampling. -Dr Rose Turnbull, NZ Geochemistry 

> The app has been such an incredible advantage in terms of workload, data quality, and a number of other data management issues with which archaeologists regularly have to deal. [...] I can see this user-friendly app being easily transferrable to other projects, and the support team has been brilliant.  -Dr Jessica Thompson, ARC Fellow and Project Director for MEMSAP 

> I am in a state of shock because I got the tablet to work and download the app with almost no trouble at all! [...] even sleep deprived OCD academics can make this sh*t work easily. -Dr Andrew Fairbairn, ARC Future Fellow, The University of Queensland
