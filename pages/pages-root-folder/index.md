## What our users say:

> ... the tablet app worked very well in the field and I would be keen to continue using it for subsequent sampling. -Dr Rose Turnbull, [NZ Geochemistry](http://www.gns.cri.nz/)

> The app has been such an incredible advantage in terms of workload, data quality, and a number of other data management issues with which archaeologists regularly have to deal. [...] I can see this user-friendly app being easily transferrable to other projects, and the support team has been brilliant.  -Dr Jessica Thompson, Project Director for the [Malawi Earlier Middle Stone Age Project](https://memsap.org/).

> I am in a state of shock because I got the tablet to work and download the app with almost no trouble at all! [...] even sleep deprived OCD academics can make this sh*t work easily. -Dr Andrew Fairbairn, ARC Future Fellow, [Boncuklu Project](http://boncuklu.org/)

## About FAIMS

The Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project (FAIMS project) is an eResearch initiative developed at UNSW, Australia and currently housed at the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University. Led by two archaeologists, a historian and a digital humanist and aided by casual programming staff, the FAIMS team has delivered 25 field recording systems over its lifetime (2012-present) to various field disciplines from archaeology, ecology, to geochemistry. We have a history of excellence in requirements elicitation, testing, delivering, and maintaining research-capable digital recording modules.

## Make your fieldwork digital

*FAIMS Mobile helps you spend less time digitising and more time learning from your data.*

Data is automatically synced and backed up, offline and on-site. If you have an Internet connection, you can also sync to the cloud. The FAIMS Mobile Platform records a full history of all data collected and any changes made. It can be tailored to work with any workflow, ontology or standard. Contact us for a demonstration and for more information about how FAIMS Mobile can make your fieldwork easier.

## Explore Australian Heritage

Historical registers across Australia hold rich and unique documentation on significant places and landscapes -- and the people and events associated with them. The information held in these heritage listings supports the conservation, maintenance and re-use of listed sites and provides a rich resource of primary and secondary material for historical, cultural and architectural researchers. The Australian e-Heritage Portal makes this material openly and easily available to researchers, educators and the community through a single Web site. The aim of the e-Heritage Portal is to provide a single online federated search interface across all of the State- and Territory-based and National heritage registers.

The first stage of the Australian e-Heritage Portal involves the development of a prototype which provides a common search interface across the Queensland and Victorian Heritage registers through the harvesting and integration of the metadata records for each heritage site. Future development will involve the integration of heritage registers/databases from the other states and territories (e.g., NSW, South Australia, Northern Territory, ACT, WA).

The Web-based portal includes a search, browse and retrieval interface that combines keyword/ ontology searching, and mapping and time-line interfaces to allow users to interactively search for significant heritage sites (and associated photos, drawings, descriptions) by topic, place, time, creator, period etc.

## Federated Data Services

Federated services include Heurist and tDAR, with Open Context and OCHRE 'coming soon'

[Heurist](http://heuristnetwork.org) is the first tool available in this suite. Heurist is an online database for managing, analysing and interpreting digital research objects. Generate maps to spatially visualise your data and network diagrams to understand relationships in your datasets.

[The Digital Archaeological Record](http://www.tdar.org/) (tDAR) is an international digital repository for the digital records of archaeological investigations. tDAR's use, development, and maintenance are governed by Digital Antiquity, an organization dedicated to ensuring the long-term preservation of irreplaceable archaeological data and to broadening the access to these data.
