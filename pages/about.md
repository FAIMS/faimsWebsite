<a name="About"/>

The Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems Project builds tools for digital data collection in the field, and online processing and archiving of the resulting data. Project staff also advise researchers concerning the development of data management strategies that meet the requirements of major grant schemes and improve research outcomes.

The FAIMS project launched in June 2012, funded by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources program. FAIMS developed a mobile, offline, multi-user collection platform for structured, free-text, geospatial, and multimedia data. The project also supported enhancements to the Heurist online data refinement and analysis service developed at the University of Sydney, and established an Australian implementation of the Digital Archaeological Record, an online data archive developed by Digital Antiquity (USA).

Current operations are funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities grant. During 2014-2016, FAIMS is supporting field deployments at partner institutions. Experience gained from these deployments is being used to improve the mobile data collection platform.

This project is led by Macquarie University in collaboration with ten Australian and overseas university partners.
