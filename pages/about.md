<a name="About"/>

The Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project builds tools for digital data collection in the field, and online processing and archiving of the resulting data. Project staff also advise researchers concerning the development of data management strategies that meet the requirements of major grant schemes and improve research outcomes.

The FAIMS project launched in June 2012, funded by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources program. FAIMS developed a mobile, offline, multi-user collection platform for structured, free-text, geospatial, and multimedia data. The project also supported enhancements to the Heurist online data refinement and analysis service developed at the University of Sydney, and established an Australian implementation of the Digital Archaeological Record, an online data archive developed by Digital Antiquity (USA).

Current operations are funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities grant. During 2014-2016, FAIMS is supporting field deployments at partner institutions. Experience gained from these deployments is being used to improve the mobile data collection platform.

This project is led by Macquarie University in collaboration with ten Australian and overseas university partners.

### Dr Shawn Ross

* _Project Director_
* _Associate Professor, Department of Modern History, Politics and International Relations, Ancient History Department, Macquarie University_
* _Deputy Director, Big History Institute, Macquarie University_

Shawn Ross (Ph.D. University of Washington, 2001) is currently an Associate Professor of History and Archaeology and Deputy Director of the Big History Institute at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. A/Prof Rossʼs research interests include the history and archaeology of pre-Classical Greece, oral tradition as history (especially Homer and Hesiod), the archaeology of the Balkans (especially Thrace), Greece in its wider Mediterranean and Balkan context, and the application of information technology to the humanities. Since 2009, the focus of A/Prof Rossʼs work has shifted to fundamental archaeological research in Bulgaria. He is a Research Associate at the American Research Center in Sofia, Bulgaria, and supervises the Tundzha Regional Archaeological Project ([http://www.tundzha.org](http://www.tundzha.org)), a large-scale archaeological survey and palaeoenvironmental study in central and southeast Bulgaria. Since 2012 A/Prof Ross has directed the Field Acquired Information Management Systems project aimed at developing data capture, management, and archiving resources for archaeologists. He is also involved with archaeology work at the site of Troizen in the Argolid. Previously, A/Prof Ross worked at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) and William Paterson University (Wayne, New Jersey).

### Dr Penny Crook
* _Development Coordinator (La Trobe)_
* _Research Fellow, School of Historical and European Studies, La Trobe University_

Penny Crook is a Research Fellow at the School of Historical and European Studies, La Trobe University. Dr Penny Crook is a historical archaeologist, consultant and is currently the FAIMS Research Fellow in the Archaeology Program at La Trobe University. She specialises in urban assemblage analysis and material-culture studies. She designed two customised relational databases to store archaeological and historical data derived from the ARC Linkage-funded 'Exploring the Archaeology of the Modern City' project. She has collaborated with Victorian eResearch Strategic Initiative (VeRSI) and the La Trobe eResearch Office on the Australian Historical Archaeological Database (AHAD), funded by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). She has published several papers and reports on urban archaeology, consumption studies, artefact cataloguing and database design.

### Petra Janouchova

* _Client Manager_
* _PhD Student of Ancient History at Charles University in Prague & International Student at Macquarie University_

Petra is a epigrapher, which means that she reads Ancient Greek mail (mostly that written on stone). She is writing her PhD in Prague on Graeco-Thracian interaction and cultural exchange (this is an extremely interesting subject concerning SE European history). She has done her Masters in Classical Archaeology and Ancient Greek in Prague. She has come to Australia to work with the FAIMS team and to broaden her horizons. Petra likes an archaeological fieldwork and she enjoys advising other projects how to collect data in a digital form. She has used the FAIMS DIY approach to customize and deploy her own module to collect Greek and Latin inscriptions strewn about in the field as well as modern urban environment.

### Christian Nassif-Haynes

* _Junior developer_
* _Macquarie University_

Christian is finishing his BE in Software Engineering at Macquarie University. He has joined the FAIMS team in 2015 and has built tools to automate and simplify the production of FAIMS modules. Christian continues to develop FAIMS modules, finessing his automation code to accommodate even the most unique client requirements, all the while drinking neon-colored cordial and eating cookies. 



![Georgia]({{ site.urlimg }}Georgia.jpg)

### Georgia Burnett

* _Researcher_
* _Macquarie University_

Georgia is a PhD student in Ancient History at Macquarie University. Her PhD explores the space of domain specific ontologies, exploring the potential, and assessing feasibility of standardized vocabularies in archaeology. She is researching the amenability of FAIMS schemata to automated ontology mapping, which, in the long term, should facilitate semantic data interoperability and cross-regional analyses. In short, she is looking at how archaeologists can use programmable tools and inter-disciplinary approaches to better describe and manage their data in order to incentivize sharing and collaboration. 
In addition to her work with FAIMS, Georgia collaborates with academics and assists them with data cleaning, management, and visualisation.
