I"ç<p>So, after further investigation, all of the problem we‚Äôve been having is due to our little cute country-state auto-completion script dropping tens of warnings into the Apache error log‚Ä¶. every few milliseconds while people were trying to auto-complete it.</p>

<p>While this worked in our tests‚Ä¶ clearly it scaled <em>exceedingly</em> poorly. This morning, tearing out the php conversion of csv to json (which was clearly overtaxing our poor little server) left us with unexpected jquery errors.</p>

<p>So I just removed auto-completion from the survey. While it would have been a cute luxury for a different server, our IO throughput on our virtual machine is simply insufficient to the task. (Due to disk-wait, we were averaging a load of over 10 on our 15 minute average.)</p>

<p>I would like to extend my sincere apologies to everyone who encountered slowdowns or errors during the survey.</p>
