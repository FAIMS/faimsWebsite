I"<p>To all of you following along at home, it should appear as if nothing has changed. Weâ€™ve moved NeCTAR servers, however, and this should be our home for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>As the project goes, weâ€™re well into elaboration on the mobile side of things. Weâ€™re hitting our database design to see if it can stand up to the strain of our estimated number of observations and their attributes (lots and rather more than lots), testing <a href="http://www.nutiteq.com">GIS engines</a> and <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">database extensions</a> and generally reducing the risk scope of our mobile requirements.</p>

<p>Repository requirements are being elaborated and nailed down, too. Our current discussion is on the nature of DOIs and data importing.</p>
