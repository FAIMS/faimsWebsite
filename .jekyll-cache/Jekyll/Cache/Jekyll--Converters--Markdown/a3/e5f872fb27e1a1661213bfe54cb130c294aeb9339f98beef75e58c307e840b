I"≠<p>We just proposed a <a href="http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/?p=204">session </a>at THATcamp! Join us there!</p>

<p><a href="http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/files/2013/10/Adela_500103.jpg"><img src="http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/files/2013/10/Adela_500103-225x300.jpg" alt="A handful of devices" /></a>FAIMS has just returned from the Aegean, after having collected some data with our new¬†<a href="remote-sensing-the-environs-of-zagora-greece/">mobile tool</a>. We propose an interactive workshop where we explore not only how the FAIMS App works, but general methodologies for collecting data ‚Äúin the field‚Äù.</p>

<p>We also plan to have an interactive discussion on data structures for field data collection, a review of the data we collected, and a general discussion on the difficulties of technology adoption in the humanities. We invite other presenters and audience to this session.</p>

<p>Comment if you‚Äôre interested!</p>
