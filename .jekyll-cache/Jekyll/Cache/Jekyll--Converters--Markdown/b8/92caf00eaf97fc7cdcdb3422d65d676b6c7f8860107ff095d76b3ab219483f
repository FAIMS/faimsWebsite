I"Ó<p>Sorry for the long silence. Things have been just insane around here as we get ready to â€œgo goldâ€ *.</p>

<p>Still, in preparation for that, we had to make a number of screenshots, so we thought we might as well share them here.</p>

<p>Taken on my new phone, a nexus 7, and an asus TF700, we present screenshots of our new maps interface, and some of the more interesting bits of data collection.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve also made sure that thereâ€™s a demo server running, so that when we go live (beta) on Google Play, people can play with the app without a server.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve re-written the server installer, and it should work most of the time now (except when Iâ€™m not watching itâ€¦).</p>

<p>*AÂ term of ancient art, at least in the computing landscapes, as the idea of burning a golden master CDâ€¦ is cute and antiquated.</p>
