I"ó<p>Weâ€™ve just completed our first acceptance test of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/heurist/">Heurist</a>, and weâ€™re delighted to say weâ€™ve completed it, and likely passed (pending acceptance by our steering committee)</p>

<p>We installed the open-source version using a <a href="http://www.fedarch.org/test/installHeurist.sh">script I wrote</a>, and got it running on the NeCTAR cloud (with only a few hiccups that are, even now, being ironed out.)</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s even more exciting is that not only did it read in sample data (and horribly multi-valued data at that) but it read in our spatial data and rendered it in google maps! A big thank you to Arts eResearch developer Artem for setting all this up!</p>

<p>And hereâ€™s one of our studious testers toiling away at the 20 page testing documentâ€¦ (But we gave them cookies, so our exploitation was amelioratedâ€¦ a bitâ€¦)</p>

<p>And as this winds up, weâ€™re starting to prepare for our beta UAT of our mobile app and our repository! Stay tuned!</p>
