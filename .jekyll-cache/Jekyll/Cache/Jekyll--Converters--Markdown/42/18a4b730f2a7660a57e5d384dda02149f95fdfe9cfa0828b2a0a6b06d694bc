I"π<p>So it seems like our local library has ‚Äúlost‚Äù their Munsell colour chart.</p>

<p>Anyone willing to share?</p>

<p>If we were going to bake support for a colour system into our device, should we use munsell or should we go with an open standard? If so, which open standard? Is it worth trying to use the device camera?</p>

<p>(Anyone willing to share an spectrophotometer (smaller than a breadbox, please) with us to play with?)</p>
