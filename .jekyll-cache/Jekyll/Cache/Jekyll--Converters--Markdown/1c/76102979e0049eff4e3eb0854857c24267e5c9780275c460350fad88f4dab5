I"õ<p>Over 70 archaeologists, associated researchers and software developers from across Australia and overseas joined us for a four-day <a href="http://fedarch.org/ocs/index.php/FAIMS/SW2012">workshop</a> from Thursday to Sunday. We commenced a rich and thorough dialogue about a range of critical issues affectingÂ digitalÂ archaeology from data standards, to mobile technologies, federation, cultural resource management and sensitive data. The project team wish to extend their sincere thanks to <strong>all</strong> participants for giving up their time and sharing their ideas. We have much to sort through and will be posting results of the workshop and our plans for the development of the project soon. We look forward to the dialogue continuing!</p>
