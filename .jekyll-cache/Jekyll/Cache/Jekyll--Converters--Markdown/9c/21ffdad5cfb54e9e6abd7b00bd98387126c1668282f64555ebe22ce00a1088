<p>The Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project builds tools for digital data collection in the field, and online processing and archiving of the resulting data. Project staff also advise researchers concerning the development of data management strategies that meet the requirements of major grant schemes and improve research outcomes.</p>

<p>The FAIMS project launched in June 2012, funded by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources program. FAIMS developed a mobile, offline, multi-user collection platform for structured, free-text, geospatial, and multimedia data. The project also supported enhancements to the Heurist online data refinement and analysis service developed at the University of Sydney, and established an Australian implementation of the Digital Archaeological Record, an online data archive developed by Digital Antiquity (USA).</p>

<p>Current operations are funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities grant. During 2014-2016, FAIMS is supporting field deployments at partner institutions. Experience gained from these deployments is being used to improve the mobile data collection platform.</p>

<p>This project is led by Macquarie University in collaboration with ten Australian and overseas university partners.</p>

<p>Shawn Ross (Ph.D. University of Washington, 2001) is currently an Associate Professor of History and Archaeology and Deputy Director of the Big History Institute at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. A/Prof Ross ºs research interests include the history and archaeology of pre-Classical Greece, oral tradition as history (especially Homer and Hesiod), the archaeology of the Balkans (especially Thrace), Greece in its wider Mediterranean and Balkan context, and the application of information technology to the humanities. Since 2009, the focus of A/Prof Ross ºs work has shifted to fundamental archaeological research in Bulgaria. He is a Research Associate at the American Research Center in Sofia, Bulgaria, and supervises the Tundzha Regional Archaeological Project (<a href="http://www.tundzha.org">http://www.tundzha.org</a>), a large-scale archaeological survey and palaeoenvironmental study in central and southeast Bulgaria. Since 2012 A/Prof Ross has directed the Field Acquired Information Management Systems project aimed at developing data capture, management, and archiving resources for archaeologists. He is also involved with archaeology work at the site of Troizen in the Argolid. Previously, A/Prof Ross worked at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) and William Paterson University (Wayne, New Jersey).</p>

<p>Petra is an epigrapher, which means that she reads Ancient Greek mail and tombstones written more than 2000 years ago. She has done her PhD on Graeco-Thracian interaction, cultural exchange, and information dissemination in the SE Balkans during Antiquity. She has done her Masters in Classical Archaeology and Ancient Greek at the Charles University in Prague and she has come to Australia in 2016 to work with the FAIMS team and to broaden her horizons. Petra likes to do archaeological fieldwork and she enjoys helping other projects to design their data collection strategies. She has used the FAIMS DIY approach to customize and deploy her own module to collect data on Greek and Latin inscriptions that she encounters during her travels.</p>

<p>Georgia is a PhD student in Ancient History at Macquarie University. Her PhD explores the space of domain specific ontologies, exploring the potential, and assessing feasibility of standardized vocabularies in archaeology. She is researching the amenability of FAIMS schemata to automated ontology mapping, which, in the long term, should facilitate semantic data interoperability and cross-regional analyses. In short, she is looking at how archaeologists can use programmable tools and inter-disciplinary approaches to better describe and manage their data in order to incentivize sharing and collaboration. 
In addition to her work with FAIMS, Georgia collaborates with academics and assists them with data cleaning, management, and visualisation.</p>
