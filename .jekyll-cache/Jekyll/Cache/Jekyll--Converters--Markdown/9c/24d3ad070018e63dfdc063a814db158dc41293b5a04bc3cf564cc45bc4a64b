I"ø<p>On 1 February we have successfully tested our first internal prototype. The testing was internal, taking place at UNSW. ¬†Two ¬†volunteers have demonstrated the core functionality of the mobile application. After four sprints of development these features are in place now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>connectivity and communication between mobile devices and FAIMS server</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>generation of data schema and user interface via an xml document, creation of a ‚Äúnew project‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>functionality of UI elements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some elements of the logic layer, such as saving, loading, on-click events, tab actions, and creation of relationships‚Ä¶</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Kudos to Intersect for excellent progress!</p>

<p>For those who want to check our internal prototype out we will be happy to demonstrate the mobile app to any interested party upon visit at¬†our new office at UNSW after 20 February.</p>
