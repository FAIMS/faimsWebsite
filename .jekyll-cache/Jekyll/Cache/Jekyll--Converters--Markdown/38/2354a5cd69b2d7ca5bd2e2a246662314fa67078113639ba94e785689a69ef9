I"<p>I spent a few days this week, in between working through the logic layer for the mobile device, I made the FAIMS project a postcard. While it’s not holiday-themed, it does serve as a rather snappy advertisement for FAIMS.</p>

<p>I used some <a href="http://research.swtch.com/qart">interesting research into QR codes</a> conducted by Russ Cox to make us a custom QR code with the faims logo, which I think is rather effective at combining identity with the semiotic connotation of progress.</p>
