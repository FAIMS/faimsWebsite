I""<p>Here are some pictures of the deployment of the FAIMS app for ground truthing the results of satellite image analysis at the <a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/zagora/category/zagora-dig-blog/">Zagora Archaeological Project in Greece</a>.  I have been invited to explore the environs of Zagora, a fascinating Early Iron Age site on the island of Andros. I did this with the help of assistant Petra Janouchova and WorldView satellite imagery, which we first rectified, then analyzed and then exported to the FAIMS app for ground control.</p>

<p>The app provides wonderfully clear and detailed maps in comparison to ArcPAD (which we run as a backup) and shapefiles that I create in ArcGIS during the RS analysis can be exported to the app thanks to a single line of code.  Petra and I use our 4” Google phones (Samsung Nexus Galaxy i9250). We have found it a lightweight and easy tool to have handy at all times while scrambling up steep local slopes with insanely prickly vegetation.</p>

<p>The schema for ground control data collection was generated in Heurist and debugged by Brian in the first two days of our fieldwork. As there is good internet I use the Cloud server to sync the data on daily basis. It works! I am thrilled to have such good maps and to have my pictures captured instantly with all the ground control data and coordinates. It’s easy and it’s fun!</p>
