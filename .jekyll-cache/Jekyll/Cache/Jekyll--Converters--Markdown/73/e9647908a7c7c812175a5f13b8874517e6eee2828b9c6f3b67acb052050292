I"…<p>If youâ€™re submitting an ARC Discovery or Linkage Grant in the upcoming round andÂ need help with your data management plan, thereâ€™s still time!Â FAIMS has a suite of tools to assist you manage your data.</p>

<p><strong>Why use FAIMS?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>FAIMS software, when properly deployed, allows the creation of datasets that meet all Australian data management requirements and best practice guidelines published by the <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/applicants/open_access.htm">ARC</a> and <a href="http://ands.org.au/datamanagement/">ANDS</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FAIMS mobile application offers an Android-based, offline-capable, GIS-enabled tool for flexible data capture. It is fully customisable to your workflows, data schemata and terminology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FAIMS mobile application can greatly facilitate the production of clean, well-structured, error-free datasets that are ready for submission to an archive, repository, or publication service. Provided they are conceived and designed properly (something else we can assist!), these datasets will be reusable and re-purposeable for regional, comparative, and synthetic studies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FAIMS repository (an implementation of tDAR) conforms to international best practices and has been endorsed by the Society of American Archaeology and National Science Foundation in the US.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
