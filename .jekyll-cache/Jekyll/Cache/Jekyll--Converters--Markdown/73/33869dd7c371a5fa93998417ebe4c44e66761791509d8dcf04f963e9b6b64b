I"¨<p><a href="http://repo.fedarch.org">The FAIMS Repository</a> is currently under migration to the main branch of <a href="http://www.tdar.org">The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR)</a>, hosted by the <a href="https://www.digitalantiquity.org/news/">Center for Digital Antiquity</a> at Arizona State University, a long-time FAIMS partner.</p>

<p>As you may recall, the FAIMS repository was established in 2013 to provide a pan-archaeological archive for Australian archaeology. Regrettably, we have found it difficult to find reliable local data curation services at a reasonable cost, and have not been able to secure additional funding for ongoing system administration.  After extensive review of curated archaeological data services and consultation with our Steering Committee, we have made the decision to transfer the data to tDAR. Also, as you may recall, the FAIMS Repository was an Australian implementation of tDAR, making the transfer easier. You can read more about the reason for migration <a href="http://repo.fedarch.org/#more">here.</a></p>

<p>What next?  We will post again when the transfer is complete and everyone will be invited to create a new account in tDAR.</p>
