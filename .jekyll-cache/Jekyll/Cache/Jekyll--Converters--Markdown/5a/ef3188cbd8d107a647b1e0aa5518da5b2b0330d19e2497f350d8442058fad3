I"Î<p>The certainty slider has just been implemented in our prototype app. It is a pretty exciting feature, that will allow users to record a kind of confidence rating for every piece of data they collect. So if youâ€™re tempted to throw in a ? at the end of attribute but itâ€™s not on the list click the certainty button, drag down the slider and future users will know you were a little uncertain about calling that â€˜wall-looking-featureâ€™ a â€˜wallâ€™. The feature can be turned on or off so if youâ€™re confident in all your recording, or just donâ€™t need to verify that today is today, you donâ€™t need to clutter the screen with the icon.</p>
