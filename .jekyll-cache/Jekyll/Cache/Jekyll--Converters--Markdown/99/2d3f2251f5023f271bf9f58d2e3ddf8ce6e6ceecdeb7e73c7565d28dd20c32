I"ô<p>Weâ€™ve successfully initiated serial level communication over bluetooth to a Sokia SET550Rx, and weâ€™re quite confident that weâ€™ll be able to engineer this into the app.</p>

<p>With that said, compatibility is model specific. So if <em>you</em> want an external sensor device working with the app, loan it to us for a week or so, and weâ€™ll see what we can do. Have we mentioned that weâ€™re looking for partners for our 2014 grant application? We are.</p>
