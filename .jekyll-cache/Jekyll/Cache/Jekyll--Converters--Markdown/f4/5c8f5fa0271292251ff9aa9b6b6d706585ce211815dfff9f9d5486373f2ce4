I"-<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>Our LIEF partners at UQ have asked FAIMS to give a presentation about how our mobile platform works, and they’ve generously decided to share it with everyone!</p>

<p>You can catch the livestream event <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/clgnefcdia94um4pokkktp75s94">here</a> (or the recorded version after the fact). It starts at 9AM. The video link below will go live then as well.</p>
