I"„<p>Ethan Watrall, associate director of<a href="http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/"> MATRIX</a>, emailed me that he will be running aÂ <strong>Cultural Heritage Informatics (CHI) Fieldschool</strong> at Michigan State University on 27 May - 3 July.</p>

<p>The 2013 theme is â€œVisualization: Time, Space, and Data.â€</p>

<p>During the five weeks, students and other participants willÂ collaboratively work on cultural heritage informatics projects. In the process they will learn to envision and build applications and digital user experiences for cultural heritage â€“ exploring skills such as programming, web design &amp; development, user experience design, project management, and digital storytelling.</p>

<p>Interested? Read more atÂ <a href="http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/fieldschool/">http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/fieldschool/</a></p>

<p>I surely feel like I could use this courseâ€¦</p>
