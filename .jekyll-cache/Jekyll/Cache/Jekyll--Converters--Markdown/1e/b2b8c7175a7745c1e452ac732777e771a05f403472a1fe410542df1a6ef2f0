I"l<p>Yesterday night we took the opportunity to listen to a panel of mentors and business “accelerators” from Google Australia, and afterwards to mingle and exchange our experiences with other start-up project managers and engineers.  You can watch the event here via the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEntrepreneurs/posts/VAGbCtNoCD5">hangout</a>.</p>

<p>It was a fun learning experience. Besides loads of business advice, the main message we took back from the night was to take <strong>extra care</strong> of our clientèle,  and to “really pamper and nurture our first ten adopters”.</p>

<p>We are taking the message to heart and invite those of you who are running archaeological projects or organizing new projects to <strong>hurry and be among the first ten FAIMS users</strong> so you can reap the benefits of our VIP customization service!</p>
