I"‡<p>So, just to make a sample commit, Iâ€™m testing to see if our <a href="https://github.com/phayes/hookserve">webhook</a> on github commits actually eats the markdown file <a href="http://github.com/FAIMS/faimsWebsite/_posts/2016-05-16-postingFromGithub.md">this thing Iâ€™m writing right now on github</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, if I commit things, git tells a tiny daemon on the server to pull this repository. The Jekyll listener then remakes the html, and pushes the blog post. Like magic. Secure, secure magic.</p>

<p>Of course, the first commit I did didnâ€™t work, so Iâ€™m trying again. And a third time, this time with a shell script.</p>
