&gt; ## Abstract

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;

&gt; Archaeology suffers from a disconnect between datasets. WithoutÂ interoperable data, projects remain local, relevant only to a pocket of discussion.Â Interoperable data is only achievable through standardisation. Metadata has been favoured in archaeology as a means of capturing datasets; however,Â metadata cannot facilitate the required level of interoperability needed whenÂ performing large-Â­â€scale automated comparisons. Content standards---specifically,Â standardised vocabularies to ensure semantic interoperability---are needed.Â Ontologies are the best representation for standardised vocabularies in archaeology. Ontologies not only quantify the term in a hierarchy, but also allowÂ for the term to exist over several layers of the network.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;

&gt; Not only does archaeology require content standards, however; theÂ standards that are designed must reflect the natural language of the discipline. They must reflect the nuanced vocabularies of archaeologists in practice. TextÂ analysis provides a viable way of producing a natural language ontology. This thesis makes the first steps towards a natural language ontology by determiningÂ relationships between related terms. Positional indexing, a derivative of latent semantic analysis, provides a method of determining relationships betweenÂ terms in a domain-Â­â€specific corpus of literature. By doing so, it ensures anÂ ontology reflective of the domain. Synonym extraction for ontology development is considered a key feature of future research.
