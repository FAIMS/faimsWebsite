I"Û<p>When we moved to the RAAP funding, I decided that it was time that we moved from our antiquated Wordpress design to a static site. Conversion from markdown (source for the post is <a href="https://github.com/FAIMS/faimsWebsite/tree/master/_posts/2016">here</a>) mainly involved using the <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">ExitWP</a> tool to extract our content from wordpress, customising our theme (<a href="https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/">Feeling Responsive</a> by Phlow), and figuring out our deployment solution.</p>

<p>As an aside, as our previous webhook was using entirely too much CPU (some seventeen thousand hours versus the one hour for nginx, I‚Äôm also using this post to test my new solution. You may see edits appear if you‚Äôre reading this in an <a href="http://newsblur.com">RSS reader</a>). This post, in many ways, is also something of a guide to ‚Äúhow to publish a markdown post.‚Äù</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown cheatsheet</a> may be handy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the latest copy of the repo
    <ol>
      <li>If you don‚Äôt have the repository on your computer yet: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone git@github.com:FAIMS/faimsWebsite.git</code>
        <ol>
          <li>You‚Äôll need to make sure that git is set up on your computer properly. Follow the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/">Generating an SSH Key</a> instructions.</li>
          <li>This is because you are, of course, using two factor authentication, which makes https extremely tedious to login using.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If you do have the repository, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Write your blog post
    <ol>
      <li>Copy a prior post in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">posts/2016/</code> directory</li>
      <li>Edit the header content
        <ol>
          <li>Find a good full-width banner which is creative commons. Put it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/images/</code>.</li>
          <li>Make sure to link and give attribution.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a post in a text editor of your choice. Use the markdown cheatsheet as linked above to remember formatting. (Technically pandoc is possible, but conversion is just tedious and unnecessary for simple blog posts).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Commit your repository
    <ol>
      <li>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">faimsWebsite/</code> directory, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add -A</code></li>
      <li>Then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit -a -m "Your commit message here"</code>
        <ol>
          <li>A good commit message is important, as it is a quick summary of what action you‚Äôre taking</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Push your repository to github
    <ol>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Then, my <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">webhook</a> calls its <a href="https://github.com/bketelsen/captainhook">listener</a>. This causes the webserver to pull the latest copy from github, and then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code>. Results should show up on this website in 10 seconds or so.</li>
</ol>

<p>The benefit to this approach is that the webserver is stoneaxe simple. It‚Äôs literally just <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> with no server-side scripting layer. This dramatically reduces cpu cycles spent as well as our threat surface. And, because we have lots of repositories (each git repository can stand alone) ‚Äì we have much greater data reliability and integrety than we would with wordpress and a single source of backups. Post writing occurs in the text editor of our choice, and we don‚Äôt have to struggle with an often slow and frustrating web interface to ‚Äúpreview‚Äù and ‚Äúpublish‚Äù posts. It‚Äôs faster, more secure, and simpler.</p>
