I"¶<p>If you were ever wondering who are the people hidden behind FAIMS in 2016, we are a group of academics and students at Macquarie University. FAIMS currently has two full-time developers (Brian and Christian), one part-time manager (Petra); two academics (Shawn and Adela) are volunteering their time in kind to help with administration, outreach, and testing. We offer internships to students and volunteers on rolling basis and train them in software testing. We currently have three students assisting us with development, documentation, and fun things such as archaeo-gaming etc. If you want to know more about us, see <a href="https://www.fedarch.org/about/#Team">Our Team</a> page.</p>
