<p>During the most recent sprint, Intersect gave us a tracklog feature. We save GPS data, either every unit time (the second half of the walk) or by distance away from the prior point (the first part of the walk) as an Archaeological Entity, along with associated accuracy and heading.</p>

<p>With a (mostly) simple query, we pulled this from the produced database, turned it into CSV, and then imported that CSV into arcGIS. <em>Et voila</em> we have the map above. Airplanes were cuter than normal arrows.</p>
