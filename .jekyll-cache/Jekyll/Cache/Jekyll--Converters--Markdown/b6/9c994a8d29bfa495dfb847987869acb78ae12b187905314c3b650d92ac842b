I"e<p>A tantalizing hint of whatâ€™s to come from our friends at <a href="http://sol1.com.au/">Solutions First</a>. They did some fantastic work on the <a href="https://wiki.fedarch.org:8443/display/FAIMS/Installing+and+Running+the+FAIMS+Server">Debian Installer</a> for the FAIMS server, are huge contributors to the open source community, and are now doing some (super secret!) hardware work for us.</p>

<p>Would you like to take one of these into the field?</p>
