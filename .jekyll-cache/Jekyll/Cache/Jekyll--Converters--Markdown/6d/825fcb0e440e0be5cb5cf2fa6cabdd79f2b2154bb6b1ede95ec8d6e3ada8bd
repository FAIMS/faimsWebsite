<p>FAIMS Mobile can now print QR codes and labels while you are in the field using the handheld <a href="https://www.zebra.com/ap/en/support-downloads/printers/mobile/qln420.html">Zebra QLn420</a> printer and <a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/printers/mobile/p4t.html">Zebra P4T</a>.
FAIMS Mobile integrates the printer with a click of a button, connecting the app to the Zebra QLn420 via bluetooth.</p>

<p>To further enhance you label printing experience we work with extra long-life thermal labels/wax ribbons, a future looking setup for collections that are looking to keep their samples for the long-term.</p>

<p>We would like to thank <a href="https://www.gammasolutions.com/">Gamma Solutions Pty. Ltd.</a> at Macquarie Park for providing a test printer to our development team, to make the integration possible.</p>
