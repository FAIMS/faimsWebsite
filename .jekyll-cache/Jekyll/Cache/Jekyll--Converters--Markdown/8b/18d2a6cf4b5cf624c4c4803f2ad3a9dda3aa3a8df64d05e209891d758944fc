<p>As you can see from the (slightly blurry picture), the iBalance M01’s weight is being transmitted through a Parani SD1000 rs232 to serial adapter to my phone’s terminal program.</p>

<p>And, with a pin of 1234, it <em>just worked.</em> I paired with the phone and connected and weights were transmitted.</p>

<p>This bodes very well for development. (And our attempt to talk with the far more sophisticated totalstation next).</p>
