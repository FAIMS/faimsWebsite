I"ã<p>My first AAA Conference experience is consistent with my own fieldwork experiments: give a group of archaeologists couple interesting topics to talk about and a stopwatch to time the presentations, supply all the coffee and food they need, (plus a happy hour) and they will perform beyond expectation. AAA in Wollongong has seen some 450 archaeologists, deeply engaged in stimulating plenary talks, (uber punctual) session papers, tables of gourmet food,Â and socializing activities. This vibrant meeting was the perfect environment for us from FAIMS to shake hands with most of our Australian stakeholders, and extend the networks a bit further.</p>

<p>Running an asynchronous project with dispersed stakeholder base can be a challenge and it is great to be able to put faces to the email addresses. I personally enjoyed seeing Australian archaeologists â€˜doingâ€™ their research, Â because it gave me a better idea of where and how our tools may be applied. Three cheers to triple A.</p>
