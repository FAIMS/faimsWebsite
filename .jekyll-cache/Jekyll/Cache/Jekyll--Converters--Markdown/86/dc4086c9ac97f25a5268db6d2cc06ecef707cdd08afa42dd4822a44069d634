<p>Last week, FAIMS and colleagues from Macquarie University went to the <a href="http://www.urbangrowth.nsw.gov.au/projects/parramatta-north/">Discover North Parramatta Open Day</a> organised by <a href="http://www.urbangrowth.nsw.gov.au">UrbanGrowth NSW</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Parramatta North Urban Transformation program will conserve, unlock and share the heritage of Parramatta North.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We met with archaeologists and students to talk â€˜digital field recordingâ€™ and showcased some of our latest modules for <a href="http://www.fedarch.org/faims-mobile/">FAIMS mobile</a>.
Thank you to everyone involved for a great day in Parramatta!</p>
