I" <p>Part of the FAIMS team is currently in the field, assisting with the digital recording and documentation of excavation of the the Bleichert’s Ropeway, located right below the famous Scenic world in Katoomba, just a few hundred metres from the world-known Three Sisters.</p>

<p>The team of six Macquarie University students is lead by archaelogist Elaine Lin, who is introducing them to the world of digital recording and excavating an Australian historic site. The focus of this particular project is the tension pit belonging to the Bleichert’s Ropeway that carried shale across the Jamison Valley in the 1880s.</p>

<p>The project runs from 17th to 21st September with the kind support of John Merson of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Centre, Phil Hammon of the Scenic World, and Chris Banffy of the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service.</p>

<p>The digital recording is done on Android tablets using slightly modified version of the FAIMS ‘Simple Excavation’ demo module and so far all is running smoothly. We will keep you posted!</p>
