<p>We’ve discovered an absolutely amazing tool called <a href="https://floobits.com/help/faq">Floobits</a>. They provide <em>multi-user real time</em> collaborative code editing in the editor of our choice (Sublime Text). We were astonished at how useful this sort of in-editor collaboration was. They’re also giving us an educational discount on our workspace, so go them! And all the coders out there who have to collaborate on any closer time-scale than git commits (here’s our <a href="https://github.com/FAIMS">github</a>) should check them out!</p>
