I"&<p>Here’s an end-of-year gift of information for those FAIMS stakeholders who are anxiously waiting to know what we are focusing on in 2013. In the <a href="http://www.fedarch.org/wordpress/?attachment_id=478">Software Development Plan</a> you can find a composite document that outlines our development in the next year. This little monster consists of:</p>

<p>(1)  technical narrative of FAIMS development plans for 2013</p>

<p>(2)  user stories showing how the FAIMS applications will fit in the archaeological workflow</p>

<p>(3)  requirements that form the basis for the <em>Mobile Application,</em> being developed by Intersect, NSW</p>

<p>(4)  extensions to Heurist built by Arts eResearch at University of Sydney to serve as <em>Data Editing</em> space for FAIMS</p>

<p>(5)  development plan for the new <em>Repository</em> (AHAD+) , prepared by VeRSI.</p>

<p>This and several other reports are also available from the Resources  &gt; Project Reports menu.</p>

<p>We wish a Happy New Year to all FAIMS supporters!</p>

<p>FAIMS team</p>
