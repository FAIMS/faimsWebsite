I"u<p>In preparation for proxying our crowd, wiki, and jira servers through this domain, I first added some lovely ssl to our blog. Now fedarch.org can <em>only</em> be accessed through ssl, preventing some fairly nasty man-in-the-middle attacks. And it’s something that we should have done a while ago.</p>

<p>Please e-mail brian@ if you’re having any problems and I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<p>Mmm, lovely green lock… signed by Comodo, even. None of this self-signed cert stuff for us, anymore…</p>
