				<title>Printing Labels on the Go</title>
				<link>https://www.fedarch.org/news/YesWeCan/</link>
				<pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Tao River Archaeological Project in China has been using FAIMS to record their excavation and sampling activities since 2016. Installing mobile apps on devices in China is not without its challenges, given the inaccessibility of Google (and therefore Play Store) in the country. With meticulous preparation and great patience on the part of project director, Dr Rowan Flad from Harvard University, we have solved this and many other issues. This year Dr Flad wants to connect their field module to a mobile barcode printer to facilitate the production of human- and machine-readable labels. We are, therefore, expanding their FAIMS module to connect to a mobile Zebra printer over the Bluetooth and produce such labels on the basis of existing records at the push of a button. All of the development is happening remotely, with our team in Sydney working with a Zebra printer kindly loaned by the Gamma Solutions, while Dr Flad communicates his needs. He will harness his own mobile printer to test the new functionality after he finishes spring semester in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
The success of deploying digital tools in the field depends on the upfront investment of effort by the field researcher into discovering their needs and testing the initial prototypes. The Tao River Project team has demonstrated that digital tools are a priority and the increasingly sophisticated module is a testimony to their successful co-development with FAIMS.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mapping the lost mining settlements in the Blue Mountains</title>
				<link>https://www.fedarch.org/news/BlueMountainsOne/</link>
				<pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Ruined Castle, 27 April 2018: It is fall break at Macquarie University. Some students choose to rest or study for exams, others have chosen to spend a week wading through the ferns in the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in search of the remains of a 19th century shale mining village. Under the direction of Bec Parkes of Lantern Heritage and Shawn Ross of Macquarie University, the team of seven history and archaeology students have been getting up at 6 am to hike down the Golden Staircase and conduct archaeological survey. 
Once on site, students break up into teams of two and systematically scrutinize the ground looking for modifications on boulders, patterns in collapsed stones, scatters of glass and ceramics that indicate the location of miners’ huts. Dozens of such features are hiding under the dense canopy mere meters of the Ruined Castle treck. Upon discovery students record the location digitally, using Android tablets to capture coordinates from external GPS, and describing feature characteristics, such as materials, dimensions, finds and interpretations. All features are photographed and sketched, keeping all records integrated on the tablet. A flag is left on the ground for the official project photographer. In five days of work, students progress from knowing the word ‘survey’ to recognising and digitally recording over 250 historical features. Negotiating rugged terrain, and climbing the equivalent of 73 flights of stairs each day has been not only a fantastic way to spend the holidays, but a meaningful undertaking that generated an analysis-ready dataset that illustrates the history of industrial settlement in the Blue Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

				<pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to invite you to our upcoming seminar on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cas.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@smah/documents/doc/uow232918.pdf&quot;&gt;FAIMS Project and Information infrastructure for reproducibility in field sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wollongong this Friday, 2nd June 2017 presented by A / Prof Shawn Ross and Dr Adela Sobotkova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Date: Friday 2nd June 2017&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time: 3:30 - 4:30 PM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Venue: 41.G03A, UOW&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presenter: A / Prof Shawn Ross and Dr Adela Sobotkova&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offical Event Page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cas.uow.edu.au/news/index.html&quot;&gt;Events: Centre for Archaeological Science, University of Wollongong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, FAIMS set out to build mobile software for field data capture in archaeology, improve the Australian Historical Archaeology Database (AHAD) into a general Australian archaeological data repository, and federate these components with other data services. In the interim, our focus has evolved. Today, FAIMS maintains one of the most widely used scientific mobile data collection platforms, deployed not only in archaeology but in other field sciences like geology and ecology. 
Having customised FAIMS Mobile for over two dozen projects, we gained insights into the field research data lifecycles, as well as the socio-technical challenges of applying new technologies to fieldwork.
In this presentation, we will briefly review the history of the project and the nature of the mobile data collection platform. We will discuss FAIMS experiences with transforming digital archaeological practice. Finally, we will present future plans, including development of platforms that support computational reproducibility in archaeology and archaeological sciences..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward seeing you in Wollongong!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Measure Twice, Cut Once: Cooperative Deployment of a Generalized, Archaeology Specific Field Data Collection System</title>
				<link>https://www.fedarch.org/news/MobilisingThePast/</link>
				<pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Adela, Shawn, Andy, Jessica, Parker, and myself are proud to announce our chapter in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedigitalpress.org/mobilizing-the-past-for-a-digital-future/&quot;&gt;Mobilizing the Past&lt;/a&gt; is out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure Twice, Cut Once: Cooperative Deployment of a Generalized, Archaeology-Specific Field Data Collection System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By: Adela Sobotkova, Shawn A. Ross, Brian Ballsun-Stanton, Andrew Fairbairn, Jessica Thompson, and Parker VanValkenburgh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS) Project is an Australian, university-based initiative developing a generalized, open-source mobile data collection platform that can be customized for diverse archaeological activities. Three field directors report their experiences adapting FAIMS software to projects in Turkey, Malawi, and Peru, highlighting three themes: (1) the transition from paper to digital recording has upfront costs with backend pay-off, (2) the transition involves decisions and tradeoffs that archaeologists and technologists need to make together, and (3) digital recording has both short- and long-term benefits. In the short-term, project directors reported efficient acquisition of richer, more accurate, data. Longer-term, they anticipated that the availability of comprehensive, born-digital datasets would support rigorous demonstration of field intuitions and faster publication of more complete datasets. We argue that cooperative development involving archaeologists and technologists can produce high-quality, fit-for-purpose software, representing the best chance to embedding new technology in established projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/documents/3_2_sobotkova.pdf&quot;&gt;Read it now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
