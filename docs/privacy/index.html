<p>Policy Version 1.0.0 (8-Mar-2017)</p>

<p>Parent document: <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/privacy">http://www.mq.edu.au/privacy</a></p>

<h1 id="purpose">1	PURPOSE</h1>

<p>This Policy provides guidance on the information handling practices of the Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project (FAIMS), a project group led by Macquarie University, New South Wales, Australia (University), in relation to the personal and health information of its mobile app users and others who interact with it.</p>

<h1 id="background">2	BACKGROUND</h1>

<p>FAIMS is committed to protecting personal and health information while undertaking its learning and teaching, research, engagement, and associated administrative procedures and activities. All members of FAIMS have an obligation to be aware of and implement the privacy principles and practices established by legislation and articulated in this Policy.</p>

<p>FAIMS, as part of the University, is required to comply with statutory obligations under the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) (PPIPA) and the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW) (HRIPA), in respect of personal and health information which it collects and uses. The University aligns its practices and activities with the Information Protection Principles (IPPs), and the Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) contained in those Acts (as outlined in the University’s Privacy Management Plan).</p>

<p>The University also follows any public interest directions and statutory guidelines issued by the Information and Privacy Commission NSW (or its equivalent or replacement body) in relation to personal and health information. The University’s Privacy Management Plan provides more information on how the University implements its obligations under the PPIPA and HRIPA, and how these acts apply to the University’s operations.</p>

<h1 id="scope">3	SCOPE</h1>

<p>The scope of this Policy applies to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all employees of the University and its controlled entities,</li>
  <li>all students of the University including former students,</li>
  <li>all University researchers and HDR candidates, and</li>
  <li>any person who handles personal or health information for or on behalf of the University or its controlled entities, including contractors, agents, visitors, honorary, clinical or adjunct appointees and consultants of the University.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="definitions">4	DEFINITIONS</h1>

<p>Commonly defined terms are located in the University <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/glossary/search">Glossary</a>. The following definitions apply for the purpose of this Policy:</p>

<p><strong>Controlled entity/entities</strong>: a person, group of persons or body of which the University or the University Council has control within the meaning of Section 39 (IA) or 45A (IA) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pfaaa1983189/">Public Finance and Audit Act 1983</a> (NSW).</p>

<p><strong>Information</strong>: personal or health information (or both as the context requires).</p>

<p><strong>Health information</strong> as defined in HRIPA is:</p>

    1. the physical or mental health or a disability (at any time) of an individual; or 
    1. an individual’s express wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her, or
    1. a health service provided or to be provided to an individual; or
b. other personal information collected to provide, or in providing a health service, or 
c. other personal information about an individual collected in connection with the donation, or intended donation, of an individual’s body parts, organs or body substances, or

<p>Personal information as defined in PPIPA is:</p>

<p><em>“information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database and whether or not recorded in a material form) about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. Personal information includes such things as an individual’s fingerprints, retina prints, body samples or genetic characteristics”.</em>

<h1 id="policy-statement">5	POLICY STATEMENT</h1>

<p>The University ensures those covered by the scope of this policy are made aware of their responsibilities under the PPIPA and HRIPA respectively and provides appropriate information and training opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="collection-and-use">Collection and use</h2>

<p>The University may collect and use personal and health information only for lawful purposes that are directly related to a function or activity of the University and where the information is reasonably necessary for that purpose; for a directly related purpose that the individual would expect; or for a purpose for which the individual has given consent.</p>

<p>The University is not required to comply with the privacy principles relating to use if an exemption under the relevant legislation applies.</p>

<h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h2>

<p>The University may disclose information held about an individual under various circumstances including the following:</p>

<p>a. 	if the disclosure is directly related to the purpose for which the information was collected and the University/controlled entity has no reason to believe that the individual concerned would object to the disclosure, or
b.	the individual concerned is reasonably likely to have been aware or is aware, or
c.	the University believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious or imminent threat to an individual’s life or health, or.
d.	consent has been given by the individual, or 
e.	disclosure is otherwise authorised, permitted, or required by law.</p>

<p>Specific restrictions on disclosure apply when made to an overseas recipient.</p>

<p>More specific information about how the University applies the IPPs and HPPs can be found in the Privacy Management Plan.</p>
