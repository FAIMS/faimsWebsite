It was very interesting being a philosopher and information

technologist among Archaeologists. Alien and unfamiliar... and

therefore very familiar: for that's the IT person's job.

The real instight of the conference was the potential of a applying

patch theory to archaeological data: making the observation the

central data collected and releagint everything else to a non-

relational mapping. Kinda blue-sky, but there's some real potential

for stealing some concepts from CS here.
