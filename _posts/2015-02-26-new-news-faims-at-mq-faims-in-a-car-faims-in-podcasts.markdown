Welcome back to the FAIMS Blog, hopefully with more updates. First and foremost, FAIMS Leadership has moved to Macquarie University, Department of Ancient History! (Our new office is Room 510, Building W6A, Macquarie University 2109). Everyone is cordially invited for coffee!

Alongside this post are images with the wonderful kits prepared by Solutions First. The top is us playing with our new Lenovo Yoga 2 tablet which can quite happily project the faims app onto the wall (which... we're honestly still trying to figure out workflows beyond "that's really cool"). We're also preparing to deploy a FAIMS-inna-truck kit for CSIRO's sampling module with built in UPS and car inverter. It's _completely awesome_.

We recently featured on the "[Indiana Jones: Myth, Reality and 21st Century Archaeology](http://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/83371/the-federated-archaeological-information-management-system-faims-project)" podcast. Discussion welcome!

Our module development schedule over the next few months is quickly filling up. If you want a module in time for the July season, make sure you're talking with usÂ _now._
