It's a warm Sunday here in Sydney and Adela, Shawn and I are in a conference room diligently responding to our Steering Committee's comments. It's interesting using these documents as a way to reflect on the elaboration already completed, and how disqualified tech (like mesh) shapes our discussion.

Some day soon database elaboration will be done and I'll post an ERD here.
