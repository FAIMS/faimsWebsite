Come see the **FAIMS Focus Paper Session** at CAA

on **Thursday 28 March, 2 -- 4pm, in Seminar room 1, UWA Club**

This session follows the "focus" format: five-minutes papers with accompanying (optional) posters, followed by plenty of discussion. This session will be interactive; our primary goal is to solicit critiques of and responses to our project, so that this input can again inform our activities. The topics discussed are

* [New E-Research Tools for Archaeologists](http://fedarch.org/pdf/ShawnPoster.pdf)

* [GIS On Android](http://www.fedarch.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads//2013/03/AdelaPoster.pdf)

* [Relational and Non-relational program independent Schemas](http://www.fedarch.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads//2013/03/BrianPoster.pdf)

* and many more...

You can review all the session papers on the CAA session [webpage](http://caa2013.org/drupal/sessions) (you will find us under S2).
