# [UNSW researchers push open source, Android for archaeology:](http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/458425/unsw_researchers_push_open_source_android_archaeology/?fp=4&fpid=1968336438)

<blockquote>The app allows the recording of text, location, imagery and audio data on Android devices, and a server can be deployed at archaeological sites that, when devices come within range, will synchronise the data on them as well as back it up on the server in an append-only data store (to offer versioning of data, if there needs to be a rollback, for example).</blockquote>
