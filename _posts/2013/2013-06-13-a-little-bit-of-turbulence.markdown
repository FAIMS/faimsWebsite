So, it looks like our server is having some troubles. Probably something with the underlying VM.

Please forgive me any server errors or slowness that pops up while I fix this.

Error found: We were full on disk space. (not entirely sure why... yet...) Fixing...

Some other, deeper errors found. As it's midnight-thirty, and everything seems to be ticking over, I'm going to put this off for tomorrow. Tomorrow looks to be a tech day moving cells to a different physical-host and trying to increase the allocated resources to this machine.
