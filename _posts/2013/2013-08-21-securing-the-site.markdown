In preparation for proxying our crowd, wiki, and jira servers through this domain, I first added some lovely ssl to our blog. Now fedarch.org can *only* be accessed through ssl, preventing some fairly nasty man-in-the-middle attacks. And it's something that we should have done a while ago.

Please e-mail brian@ if you're having any problems and I'll see what I can do.

Mmm, lovely green lock... signed by Comodo, even. None of this self-signed cert stuff for us, anymore...
