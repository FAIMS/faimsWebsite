We've successfully initiated serial level communication over bluetooth to a Sokia SET550Rx, and we're quite confident that we'll be able to engineer this into the app.

With that said, compatibility is model specific. So if *you* want an external sensor device working with the app, loan it to us for a week or so, and we'll see what we can do. Have we mentioned that we're looking for partners for our 2014 grant application? We are.
