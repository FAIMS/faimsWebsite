We just proposed a [session ](http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/?p=204)at THATcamp! Join us there!

[![A handful of devices](http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/files/2013/10/Adela_500103-225x300.jpg)](http://sydney2013.thatcamp.org/files/2013/10/Adela_500103.jpg)FAIMS has just returned from the Aegean, after having collected some data with our newÂ [mobile tool](remote-sensing-the-environs-of-zagora-greece/). We propose an interactive workshop where we explore not only how the FAIMS App works, but general methodologies for collecting data "in the field".

We also plan to have an interactive discussion on data structures for field data collection, a review of the data we collected, and a general discussion on the difficulties of technology adoption in the humanities. We invite other presenters and audience to this session.

Comment if you're interested!
