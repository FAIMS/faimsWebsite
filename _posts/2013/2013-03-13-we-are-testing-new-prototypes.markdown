It is my pleasure to announce that on 13 March 2013 we have successfully completed the testing of the second release of the FAIMS Mobile Application and the first release of the FAIMS Repository.[gallery link="file"]

Our team of Mobile Application Testers ran around the campus testing the GIS and GPS capabilities of the app, while the Repository testers used desktops for their part of the UAT.

The tests have not been easy to get through for our graduates of the Humanities', yet we are blessed with an enthusiastic and persistent team. Kudos to all of the involved!
