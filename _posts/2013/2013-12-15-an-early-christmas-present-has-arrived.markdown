Dear FAIMS community,

Adela and Shawn would like to share the happy news that at 3.46 am on 11 Dec Adela gave birth to a baby girl. Â ( For those who were at Coffs Harbour, yes, the baby did arrive a little early, but both mother and baby are doing very well)

We will be taking some leave over the holidays and early next year, and apologise in advance if we are slow to reply to email. If you do have any inquiries, leadership@fedarch.org will be monitored and one of the leadership team will get back to you.

Best wishes,

Shawn & Adela
