You may have noticed that our communication went a bit sporadic last week. That is because we were moving to our new office at UNSW! We are now ensconced in a comfortable and spacious room at Morwen Brown 101 after four months of exile and migration between various temporary spaces and offices ( thank you, Intersect).

Due to reconstructions at UNSW we may be moving again in couple of months, but until then, **please come and visit **us**Â at UNSW, MB 101![gallery]
