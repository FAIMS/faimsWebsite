Yesterday night we took the opportunity to listen to a panel of mentors and business "accelerators" from Google Australia, and afterwards to mingle and exchange our experiences with other start-up project managers and engineers.  You can watch the event here via the [hangout](https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEntrepreneurs/posts/VAGbCtNoCD5).

It was a fun learning experience. Besides loads of business advice, the main message we took back from the night was to take **extra care** of our clientèle,  and to "really pamper and nurture our first ten adopters".

We are taking the message to heart and invite those of you who are running archaeological projects or organizing new projects to **hurry and be among the first ten FAIMS users** so you can reap the benefits of our VIP customization service!
