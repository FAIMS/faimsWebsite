Ethan Watrall, associate director of[ MATRIX](http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/), emailed me that he will be running a **Cultural Heritage Informatics (CHI) Fieldschool** at Michigan State University on 27 May - 3 July.

The 2013 theme is "Visualization: Time, Space, and Data."

During the five weeks, students and other participants will collaboratively work on cultural heritage informatics projects. In the process they will learn to envision and build applications and digital user experiences for cultural heritage -- exploring skills such as programming, web design & development, user experience design, project management, and digital storytelling.

I surely feel like I could use this course...
