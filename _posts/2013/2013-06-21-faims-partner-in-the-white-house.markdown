It is my pleasure to report that Eric Kansa, the director of Alexandria Archive Institute, and partner of FAIMS, is being distinguished as the Champion of Change in open science!

He has been invited to the White House as a representative for archaeology and the humanities and social sciences in general.

Eric and his wife Sarah are celebrating 10th anniversary of the Alexandria Archive Institute this year and this is a fantastic accomplishment.

Join me in my congratulations!
