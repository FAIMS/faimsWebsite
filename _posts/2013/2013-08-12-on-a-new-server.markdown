Wheee! The server is dead, long live the server! (Well, it's an image, which raises interesting questions of personality and consciousness preservation through copies, ... but I digress into Star Trek transporter debates and p-zombies.)

We'll also have other servers up. Right now: [JIRA](http://jira.fedarch.org:8080), and soon enough crowd and confluence.
