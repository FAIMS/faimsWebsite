It is my pleasure to introduce Georgia and Corinne, two Honours students affiliated with the FAIMS project, who are writing their theses on core concepts and standards in archaeology.  They have designed a [Vocabularies, Concepts and Standards](http://fedarch.org/survey/index.php/survey/index/sid/636669/newtest/Y/lang/en) survey and are inviting all archaeologists to participate.

If you have 20 mins of time and want to share your experience, please take their[ survey](http://fedarch.org/survey/index.php/survey/index/sid/636669/newtest/Y/lang/en)!
