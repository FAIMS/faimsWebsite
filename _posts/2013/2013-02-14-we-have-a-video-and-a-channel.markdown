Say hello to the [FAIMS Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/FAIMSProject)!

[FAIMS Video Demonstration 1 - Core Functionality @ 10 weeks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Ti0iiTats)

[iframe width="853" height="480" https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-Ti0iiTats]

Just a brief semi-technical demo of where we're at conceptually speaking. In the next few weeks we anticipate a few more videos will appear talking about the technical side of things and some archaeological applications.

Tell us what you think, and share it around. It's creative commons, so if you want to remix it, go for it!
