The certainty slider has just been implemented in our prototype app. It is a pretty exciting feature, that will allow users to record a kind of confidence rating for every piece of data they collect. So if you're tempted to throw in a ? at the end of attribute but it's not on the list click the certainty button, drag down the slider and future users will know you were a little uncertain about calling that 'wall-looking-feature' a 'wall'. The feature can be turned on or off so if you're confident in all your recording, or just don't need to verify that today is today, you don't need to clutter the screen with the icon.
