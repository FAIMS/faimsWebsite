On 1 February we have successfully tested our first internal prototype. The testing was internal, taking place at UNSW.  Two  volunteers have demonstrated the core functionality of the mobile application. After four sprints of development these features are in place now:

- connectivity and communication between mobile devices and FAIMS server

- generation of data schema and user interface via an xml document, creation of a "new project"

- functionality of UI elements

- some elements of the logic layer, such as saving, loading, on-click events, tab actions, and creation of relationships...

Kudos to Intersect for excellent progress!

For those who want to check our internal prototype out we will be happy to demonstrate the mobile app to any interested party upon visit at our new office at UNSW after 20 February.
