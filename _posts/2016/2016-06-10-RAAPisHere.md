We are happy to announce that the FAIMS project has been awarded the [NSW Research Attraction and Acceleration Programme grant](http://www.chiefscientist.nsw.gov.au/investing-in-science/research-attraction-and-acceleration-program-raap) for 2016/2017. This grant will fund additional deployments of the FAIMS Mobile platform in NSW across a range of disciplines. Some of our projects include: archaeological research at Lake Mungo and in the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, water and soil geochemistry, as well as avian biology across the NSW,  and oral and archival history projects based at UNSW and Macquarie University. The NSW RAAP also allows FAIMS to cooperate with the [Alveo Virtual Laboratory project](http://alveo.edu.au/) to expand the capacity of their system to include the management and analysis of oral history data.
