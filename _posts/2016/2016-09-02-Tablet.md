Just sharing this super neat tablet in the works by one of our colleagues, Michael Rampe.

{% include gallery %}

While it's a little lower tech than the tablets we normally work with, this tablet (with the following record) is part of our exploration of 3d printing and augmented reality museums. Lots of top-secret stuff in the works, but this is so superneat!
