When we moved to the RAAP funding, I decided that it was time that we moved from our antiquated Wordpress design to a static site. Conversion from markdown (source for the post is [here](https://github.com/FAIMS/faimsWebsite/tree/master/_posts/2016)) mainly involved using the [ExitWP](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) tool to extract our content from wordpress, customising our theme ([Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) by Phlow), and figuring out our deployment solution.
