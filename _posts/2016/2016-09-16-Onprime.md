Next week, the FAIMS team will be off to Canberra for an [ON Prime](http://oninnovation.com.au/Programs/ON-Prime) workshop. The goal of this [CSIRO-powered workshop](http://www.csiro.au/en/Do-business/ON-Program/Articles/The-future-is-ON) is to help innovative projects brainstorm ideas about increasing the uptake and accelerating the adoption of respective technological innovations.
We are thrilled to be one of 40 projects across Australia to have won the ON Prime award, and excited to see what we learn.
