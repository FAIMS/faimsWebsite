If you are ever wondered when the FAIMS project will be truly "finished", we recommend you to spare the frustration and read this excellent [blog post "Evolving Your Open Source Project Infrastructure: There's No Such Thing As Done"](https://www.linux.com/blog/evolving-your-open-source-project-infrastructure-theres-no-such-thing-done) summarizing the joys and pains of developing an open source infrastucture. 

With all the rapid Android development and the speed of technology changing every day, we are constantly moving, evolving, polishing the code and rolling the heavy stone up the hill.
Do you share mutual feelings or is your open source experience completely different? We are thrilled to discuss it with you further.
