Part of the FAIMS team is currently in the field, assisting with the digital recording adn documentation of excavation of the the Bleichert Ropeway, located right below the famous Scenic world in Katoomba, just a few hundred metres from the world-known Three Sisters.

The ANU trained archaeologist Elaine Lin intoroduces six Macquarie University students to the world of Australian historic archaeology. The team is excavating the extension pit of the Ropeway that carried shale across the Jamison Valley in the 1880s.

The project runs from 17th to 21st September with the kind support of John Merson of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Centre, Phil Hammon of the Scenic World, and Chris Banffy of the National Parks & Wildlife Service. 

The digital recording is done on Android tablets using slightly modified version of the FAIMS 'Simple Excavation' demo module and so far all is running smoothly. We will keep you posted!
