We would like to announce that the FAIMS team will be exhibiting at the SAA 80th Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA on 15-19 April, 2015.

We would like to cordially invite all of those coming to the SAAs to visit us at booth no 412!

We will be showing the [FAIMS Mobile platform](), using the FAIMS-in-the-box ([preconfigured hardware](http://shop.fedarch.org/)), and helping interested participants create or customize FAIMS modules on the spot.

Come check out the FAIMS App and bring along your Android device 4.4+ for a personal demo!

If you want to get ahead in the game, download the FAIMS app beforehand (see [instructions](https://docs.google.com/a/fedarch.org/document/d/1xe86oP9Vxbwz9D3ZxhEWiUfuuNcAvNQ1iD_Tc3E7ZFU/edit#heading=h.m8gy0xh0t1mm)). We will be happy to chat and answer any questions in person.

We're looking forward to seeing many of you again!
