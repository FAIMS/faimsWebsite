<hr/>

FAIMS mobile can now print QR codes and labels while you are in the field using the handheld [Zebra QLn420](https://www.zebra.com/ap/en/support-downloads/printers/mobile/qln420.html) printer and [Zebra P4T](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/printers/mobile/p4t.html).
FAIMS mobile integrates the printer with a click of a button, connecting the app to the Zebra QLn420 via bluetooth.

To further enhance you label printing experience we work with extra long-life thermal labels/wax ribbons, a future looking setup for collections that are looking to keep their samples for the long-term.

We would like to thank [Gamma Solutions Pty. Ltd.](https://www.gammasolutions.com/) at Macquarie Park for providing a test printer to our development team, to make the integration possible.

If you would like to know more about how you can print your own labels and barcodes from FAIMS mobile or have other external devices that you would like to integrate, contact our friendly team of experts at [enquires@fedarch.org](mailto:enquires@fedarch.org).
