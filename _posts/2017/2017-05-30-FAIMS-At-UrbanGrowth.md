<hr/>

Last week, FAIMS and colleagues from Macquarie University went to the [Discover North Parramatta Open Day](http://www.urbangrowth.nsw.gov.au/projects/parramatta-north/) organised by [UrbanGrowth NSW](http://www.urbangrowth.nsw.gov.au). 

> The Parramatta North Urban Transformation program will conserve, unlock and share the heritage of Parramatta North.

We met with archaeologists and students to talk 'digital field recording' and showcased some of our latest modules for [FAIMS mobile](http://www.fedarch.org/faims-mobile/).
Thank you to everyone involved for a great day in Parramatta!
