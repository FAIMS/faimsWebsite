FAIMS attended the first Computer Applications & Qualitative Methods in Archaeology Spring Institute for Australasia from the 3rd – 8th September 2017. 

The event was held at the Australian National University’s Kioloa Coastal Campus and was jointly organised by the CAA Australasia and the Department of Archaeology, University Sydney. Participants came from all over Australia and New Zealand to discuss the use of digital technologies in archaeology and looked at recent advancements in the field. The event included sessions on Spatial Data Collectio, Terrestrial Remote Sensing, Geospatial and Geophysical Data with sessions on knowledge management systems and digital workflows and archaeological repositiories given by Robert Haubt and Shawn Ross from the FAIMS Project.

More information on the CAA Australasia event can be found here [CAA Australasia 2017 Spring Institute] (http://au.caa-international.org/spring-institute/).

We would like to thank Dr. Ian Johnson from the University of Sydney for organising this event.
