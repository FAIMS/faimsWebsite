<hr/>

We are happy to announce that FAIMS has won the Ideation Challenge focusing on identifying robust and efficient software architecture concepts and software technologies for development of the desired Field Data Capture app framework. The Ideation Challenge forms Stage 1 of the three-stage [DataApp: A Mobile App Framework for Field Data Capture ](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/dataapp-a-mobile-app-framework-for-field-data-capture-stage-1/) Challenge.

The challenge was put forward by The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey and is seeking development of an application framework to support electronic data collection and capture using mobile devices across a diverse range of data collection situations. 

The challenge is looking for applications that provide a flexible, extensible, and open source framework to enable future improvement and development of added features by a community of app developers and users.
