We would like to invite you to our upcoming seminar on the [FAIMS Project and Information infrastructure for reproducibility in field sciences](http://cas.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@smah/documents/doc/uow232918.pdf) at the University of Wollongong this Friday, 2nd June 2017 presented by A / Prof Shawn Ross and Dr Adela Sobotkova.

*Date: Friday 2nd June 2017
*Time: 3:30 - 4:30 PM
*Venue: 41.G03A, UOW
*Presenter: A / Prof Shawn Ross and Dr Adela Sobotkova
*Offical Event Page: [Events: Centre for Archaeological Science, University of Wollongong](http://cas.uow.edu.au/news/index.html). 

> Five years ago, FAIMS set out to build mobile software for field data capture in archaeology, improve the Australian Historical Archaeology Database (AHAD) into a general Australian archaeological data repository, and federate these components with other data services. In the interim, our focus has evolved. Today, FAIMS maintains one of the most widely used scientific mobile data collection platforms, deployed not only in archaeology but in other field sciences like geology and ecology. 
Having customised FAIMS Mobile for over two dozen projects, we gained insights into the field research data lifecycles, as well as the socio-technical challenges of applying new technologies to fieldwork.
In this presentation, we will briefly review the history of the project and the nature of the mobile data collection platform. We will discuss FAIMS experiences with transforming digital archaeological practice. Finally, we will present future plans, including development of platforms that support computational reproducibility in archaeology and archaeological sciences..

We are looking forward seeing you in Wollongong!
