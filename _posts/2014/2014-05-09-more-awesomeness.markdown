From Dave, over at [SolutionsFirst](http://sol1.com.au), Stickers for FAIMS-in-a-box! (The first FAIMS in a box is getting ready to ship, so if you're interested in ordering one, [let us know](mailto:leadership@fedarch.org)!)

Even more cool, the barcode scanner that Penny supplied us, a USB device from [Symbol](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16838134086) _already works in our app_. While it will take a little extra code to completely automate scanning, if you have a process that already incorporates barcodes, we can make a module for you in July.
