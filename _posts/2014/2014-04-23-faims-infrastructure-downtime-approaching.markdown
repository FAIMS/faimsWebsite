Hey folks,

According to [Nectar](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=928&sid=9698833540c0a9248b05722bbb994209):

<blockquote>A 24 hour outage is required to relocate and upgrade the cloud storage infrastructure at the University of Melbourne. Only instances in the melbourne-qh2 availability zone will be affected. The upgrade will bring further stability and increased performance to this availability zone.</blockquote>

Unfortunately, we'll have a number of impacted machines: the FAIMS mobile app sandbox, this webserver, our wiki, testrepo, and authentication server will all be down.

Downtime will span close of business on the **28th to midday on the 30th**.

Critically, if we're developing modules for you, **you will not be able to get modules-in-progress from sandbox during this downtime.**

Let us know if that's a problem and we can find a workaround.
