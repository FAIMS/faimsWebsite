In tales from mobile development...

As you can see from the (slightly blurry picture), the iBalance M01's weight is being transmitted through a Parani SD1000 rs232 to serial adapter to my phone's terminal program.

And, with a pin of 1234, it *just worked.* I paired with the phone and connected and weights were transmitted.

This bodes very well for development. (And our attempt to talk with the far more sophisticated totalstation next).
