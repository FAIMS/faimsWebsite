A tantalizing hint of what's to come from our friends at [Solutions First](http://sol1.com.au/). They did some fantastic work on the [Debian Installer](https://wiki.fedarch.org:8443/display/FAIMS/Installing+and+Running+the+FAIMS+Server) for the FAIMS server, are huge contributors to the open source community, and are now doing some (super secret!) hardware work for us.

Would you like to take one of these into the field?
