Hey folks, just a quick technical update.

Today (hopefully only today), the following servers will be randomly down as I work on getting automatic-imaging working:

* www.fedarch.org

* demo.fedarch.org

* heurist.fedarch.org

* sandbox.fedarch.org

* wiki.fedarch.org

Some of our private servers may also be affected, but shouldn't impact the availability of the above or any faims instances we are presently hosting.
