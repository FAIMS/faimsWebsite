![pierre Vincent](wp-content/uploads//2014/02/pierreVincent1.jpg) So, we're getting module development under weigh with our two new module developers, courtesy of Intersect Australia: Vincent Tran and Pierre Estephan!

We've discovered an absolutely amazing tool called [Floobits](https://floobits.com/help/faq). They provide _multi-user real time_ collaborative code editing in the editor of our choice (Sublime Text). We were astonished at how useful this sort of in-editor collaboration was. They're also giving us an educational discount on our workspace, so go them! And all the coders out there who have to collaborate on any closer time-scale than git commits (here's our [github](https://github.com/FAIMS)) should check them out!
