Howdy folks,

I've been busy porting the blog over to nginx, and updating our jira and confluence instances.

As a positive outcome of all of this, we now have a [portal for support:requests](https://jira.fedarch.org:8443/servicedesk/customer/support).Â Let us know how you like it.

We also have various e-mail addresses set up:

* Module Enquiries: [enquiries@fedarch.org](mailto:enquiries@fedarch.org)

* Info (after having read our various publications) [info@fedarch.org](mailto:info@fedarch.org)

* E-mail support: [jira@fedarch.org](mailto:jira@fedarch.org)

We'd love to hear your feedback!
