Atlassian released a security advisory for [crowd](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Crowd+Security+Advisory+2014-05-21) and [confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Security+Advisory+2014-05-21)Â warning of a critical struts security flaw allowing remote code execution. Out of a preponderance of caution, we're taking the servers down until they're fully patched.

Our wiki, jira, and test repository will not be available until early next week.
