As you may know from our multiplying emails, we are applying for an [ARC Linkage infrastructure, Equipment and Facilit](http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/lief/lief_default.htm)ies (LIEF) grant to secure funding for our continued existence in 2014. Our plan is to dedicate 2014 to the implementation and customisation of the FAIMS apps, while deploying them at select projects according to the wishes of our core partners.

Yesterday we got several good tips about applying for a LIEF from our Grant Management Office (GMO) that merit being passed on:

(1) Building up your funds: you may or may not know that if you are at a university and have secured a small fund at your school or faculty your Division of Research will likely match it. Many universities have central sources of funding sequestered for the LIEF scheme and are able to match the faculty funds two- or threefold.  GMOs often recruit promising projects for these central funds.  Don't leave all the cash for space research, contact your GMO and claim some today!

(2) LIEF NOI: let me explain this bunch of acronyms. A LIEF application is often preceded by an internal Notification of Interest that needs to be filed at every participating institution. It is good to coordinate all potential partners (Chief Investigators) at a given university, pool all the cash and put in a joint NOI.  We, as the lead institution are happy to (and in fact have to) provide you with the big picture for your NOI.  All you need to do is watch the internal NOI deadline and aim us to the proper NOI document, so we can fill out our part of it before your submission. These NOIs are not too onerous.

(3) NOI deadline: the deadlines for internal NOIs ( see above) differ widely among different universities. According to UNSW GMO  you should not worry too much if your institutional deadline has passed. The ARC has not yet published its funding rules for the 2014 round and LIEF is known as a collaborative scheme, which often makes GMOs willing to be more flexible with their internal deadlines, because universities must work together on LIEF applications.  In the worst case, if your internal deadline has passed, the pool of central funding may have been exhausted and you will not get your fund matched from your institution. Again, the best way to check is call your GMO today, and check the situation. It may not be too late!

(4) Non-university partners are welcome to join in the LIEF application. If you can commit a cash contribution, we will render back services in the value of the ARC match, should our application be successful.

Why should you become one of our core LIEF partners today? In order to get some significant multiple of the cash value of your contribution in FAIMS services.  The usual ARC match for LIEF is 2:1, which adds substantial value! The more contributions we raise, the more we can ask for from UNSW and from the ARC, and the higher chances of application success.

If you are thinking about joining us for LIEF and have not yet gotten in touch with Shawn (shawn@fedarch.org) or Adela (adela@fedarch.org), contact us today!
