Here's an end-of-year gift of information for those FAIMS stakeholders who are anxiously waiting to know what we are focusing on in 2013. In the [Software Development Plan](http://www.fedarch.org/wordpress/?attachment_id=478) you can find a composite document that outlines our development in the next year. This little monster consists of:

(1)  technical narrative of FAIMS development plans for 2013

(2)  user stories showing how the FAIMS applications will fit in the archaeological workflow

(3)  requirements that form the basis for the _Mobile Application,_ being developed by Intersect, NSW

(4)  extensions to Heurist built by Arts eResearch at University of Sydney to serve as _Data Editing_ space for FAIMS

(5)  development plan for the new _Repository_ (AHAD+) , prepared by VeRSI.

This and several other reports are also available from the Resources  > Project Reports menu.

We wish a Happy New Year to all FAIMS supporters!

FAIMS team
