...today at 10 am was a success! We witnessed a happy transformation of xml documents to sql and user interface and played with a tablet to check the basic functionality. It's a great start, kudos to Intersect!

We of the FAIMS leadership then sat down to a massive pre-Christmas push, and tried to get as much as possible done before we all leave for holidays and various other conferences. 2013 Workplan is out to the Steering Committee and the Variation Request is underway.

Merry Christmas to everyone and see you in 2013!
