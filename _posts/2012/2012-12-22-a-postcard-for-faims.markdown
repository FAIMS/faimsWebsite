I spent a few days this week, in between working through the logic layer for the mobile device, I made the FAIMS project a postcard. While it's not holiday-themed, it does serve as a rather snappy advertisement for FAIMS.

I used some [interesting research into QR codes](http://research.swtch.com/qart) conducted by Russ Cox to make us a custom QR code with the faims logo, which I think is rather effective at combining identity with the semiotic connotation of progress.
