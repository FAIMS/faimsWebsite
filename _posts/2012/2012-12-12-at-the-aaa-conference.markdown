I have just learned about a couple new archaeological mobile applications used around Australia. A useful revelation after couple months of research on the topic! Yet, for the FAIMS community this is no reason to worry.

As Mark Collard just mentioned, high level of risk often drives the technological complexity in hunter gatherer societies.  Societies adjust to stress and high risk situations by developing more varied toolkit. If we for a moment accept the possibility that archaeologists resemble hunter-gatherer communities, the same concept effectively applies to our software development for archaeological community!

Developing a new mobile tool is a risky undertaking, so we are happy to know there are multiple different initiatives underway.
